Using the ANN for Forecasting the Precipitation and Temperature for 6-hours ahead in Regina  Airport


Weather forecasts are often viewed as the most important services provided by the meteorological
profession (Leipper 1995). These forecasts however possess no intrinsic economic value unless
they influence the behavior of individuals and organizations whose activities are sensitive to
weather conditions (Murphy 1994). The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) provides
Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs) for all major airports in Australia with each capital city
TAF being valid for 24 h. These forecasts are used by the Commercial airlines and Air Services
Australia (formerly the Civil Aviation Safety Authority) for flight planning, in-flight decision
making, and optimization of airport operations. BOM staff routinely review their forecasting
performance to seek ongoing improvement, and this study is part of a coordinated effort between
Macquarie University and the BoM in relation to the Latter’s National Fog Project. The main use
of TAFs by airlines and aircraft operators is for flight planning, both pre- and intraflight. The core
component of this planning is the pilot’s “alternative fuel” decision (pretakeoff). Such decisions
are based on TAFs issued for the intended destination.
